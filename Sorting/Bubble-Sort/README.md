# Bubble Sort

## Description
> Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order.

## Complexity
> Not suitable for large data sets since the average and worst-case time complexity of Bubble Sort is O(n^2). The best case over an already-sorted list is O(n).
