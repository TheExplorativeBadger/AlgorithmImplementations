# Bucket Sort

## Description
> In the Bucket Sorting technique, the data items are distributed in a set of buckets. Each bucket can hold a similar type of data. After distributing, each bucket is sorted using another sorting algorithm. After that, all elements are gathered on the main list to get the sorted form.

## Complexity
> O(n + k) for best case and average case and O(n^2) for the worst case.
