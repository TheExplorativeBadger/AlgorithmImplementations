# Bucket Sort

## Description
> In the Bucket Sorting technique, the data items are distributed in a set of buckets. Each bucket can hold a similar type of data. After distributing, each bucket is sorted using another sorting algorithm. After that, all elements are gathered on the main list to get the sorted form. For an optimal sorting complexity, all the elements of the original array must be evenly distributed.

## Complexity
> O(n) for best case and average case and O(n^2) for the worst case.
